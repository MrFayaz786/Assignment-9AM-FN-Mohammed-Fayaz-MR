    <h1>INDIA</h1>
    <p class="INDIA">
      India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is
      the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023;
      and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.
      Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
      southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders
      with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
      Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.
    </p>
    <h2>INDIA CLIMATE</h2>
    <p id="INDIA_CLIMATE">
      The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar
      Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer
      and winter monsoons.The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic
      winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer
      than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial
      role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds
      that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall
    </p>
    <h3>BIO DIVERSITY</h3>
    <p>
      India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that
      display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively
      indigenous, or endemic, to them. India is the habitat for 8.6% of all
      mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian
      species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant
      species. Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.
