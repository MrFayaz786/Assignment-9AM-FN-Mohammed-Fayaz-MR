    <p class="INTERNAL">
      Boxing is a combat sport and martial art. Taking place in a boxing ring
      ,It involves two people usually wearing protective equipment, such as
      protective gloves, hand wraps, and mouthguards throwing punches at each
      other for a predetermined amount of time. Although the term 'boxing' is
      commonly attributed to the Western style, where only the fists are used,
      it has evolved differently across various geographical regions and
      cultures worldwide.The modern sport arose from illegal venues and outlawed
      prizefighting and has become a multibillion-dollar commercial enterprise.
      A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around
      the world.
